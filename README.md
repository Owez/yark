# Yark

YouTube archiving made simple.

[Installation](#installation) ¬∑ [Managing your Archive](#managing-your-archive) ¬∑ [Viewing your Archive](#viewing-your-archive)

Yark lets you continuously archive all videos and metadata for YouTube channels. You can also view your archive as a seemless offline website ‚ú®

## Installation

To install Yark, simply download Python 3.9+ and run the following:

```shell
$ pip3 install yark
```

## Managing your Archive


Once you've installed Yark, think of a name for your archive and copy the target's url:

```shell
$ yark new owez https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMdm6bUYIBN0KfS2CVuEPA
```

Now that you've created the archive, you can tell Yark to download all videos and metadata using the refresh command:

```shell
$ yark refresh owez
```

Once everything has been downloaded, Yark will automatically give you a status report of what's changed since the last refresh:

<p><img src="examples/image/../images/cli_dark.png" alt="Report Demo" title="Report Demo" width="600" /></p>

## Viewing your Archive

Viewing you archive is easy, just type `view` with your archives name:

```shell
$ yark view owez
```

This will pop up an offline website in your browser letting you watch all videos üöÄ

<p><img src="examples/images/viewer_light.png" alt="Viewer (Light)" title="Viewer (Light)" style="border-radius:4px;" width=600 /></p>
<p><img src="examples/images/viewer_dark.png" alt="Viewer (Dark)" title="Viewer (Dark)" style="border-radius:4px;" width=600 /></p>

Also, under each video is a rich history report filled with timelines and graphs, as well as a noting feature which lets you add timestamped and permalinked comments üëê

## Details

Here are some things to keep in mind when using Yark; the good and the bad:

- Don't create a new archive again if you just want to update it, Yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps
- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository
- Scheduling isn't a feature just yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar!
