# Yark

Dead version of Yark which was originally slated to be the v1.3 candidate but has since been dropped in favour of another rewrite.

This branch still exists as a time capsule, and also has content which has been re-used inside of the new version of Yark. See [`v1.3-dead-original`](https://github.com/Owez/yark/tree/v1.3-dead-original) for a more complete story :)
