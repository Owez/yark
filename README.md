## Details

Some things to keep in mind when using Yark; the good and the bad:

- Don't create a new archive again if you just want to update it, Yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps
- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository
- Scheduling isn't a feature just yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar!
