# Yark

YouTube archiving made simple.

[Installation](#installation) ¬∑ [Managing your Archive](#managing-your-archive) ¬∑ [Viewing your Archive](#viewing-your-archive)

Yark lets you continuously archive all videos and metadata for YouTube channels. You can also view your archive as a seamless offline website ‚ú®

## Installation

To install Yark, simply download [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (optional), then run the following:

```shell
$ pip3 install yark
```

## Managing your Archive

Once you've installed Yark, think of a name for your archive (e.g., "foobar") and copy the target's url:

```shell
$ yark new foobar https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSMdm6bUYIBN0KfS2CVuEPA
```

Now that you've created the archive, you can tell Yark to download all videos and metadata using the refresh command:

```shell
$ yark refresh foobar
```

Once everything has been downloaded, Yark will automatically give you a status report of what's changed since the last refresh:

## Viewing your Archive

Viewing you archive is easy, just type `view` with your archives name:

```shell
$ yark view foobar
```

This will pop up an offline website in your browser letting you watch all videos üöÄ

Under each video is a rich history report filled with timelines and graphs, as well as a noting feature which lets you add timestamped and permalinked comments üëê

Light and dark modes are both available and automatically apply based on the system's theme.

## Details

Here are some things to keep in mind when using Yark; the good and the bad:

- Don't create a new archive again if you just want to update it, Yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps
- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository
- Scheduling isn't a feature just yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar!

## Archive Format

The archive format itself is simple and consists of a directory-based structure with a core metadata file and all thumbnail/video data in their own directories as typical files:

- `[name]/` ‚Äì Your self-contained archive
  - `yark.json` ‚Äì¬†Archive file with all metadata
  - `yark.bak` ‚Äì Backup archive file to protect against data damage
  - `videos/` ‚Äì Directory containing all known videos
    - `[id].*` ‚Äì Files containing video data for YouTube videos
  - `thumbnails/` ‚Äì Directory containing all known thumbnails
    - `[hash].png` ‚Äì Files containing thumbnails with its BLAKE2 hash

It's best to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your archive by looking at files which look interesting to you in it, everything is quite readable.
